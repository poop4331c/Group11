## Vision Statement

For gamers who are interested in brain-controlled play, the Dorodango is a three-dimensional rolling-ball game that allows players to control a sprite and avoid obstacles by thinking. Unlike other EEG games, which consist of a single onscreen element with no background or scoring, our game will have a fully detailed map, player feedback, a scoreboard, and normal 3d game elements such as obstacles and powerups.
